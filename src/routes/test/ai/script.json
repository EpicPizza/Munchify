				"visual": "[IMPORTANT NOTE] Follow the directions in this section exactly as stated when generating the video. Every interval should begin with a fading in animation and a fading out animation. The interval fades in from black to a deep olive green background. In the center of the 16:9 frame is a large, silhouette-forward human head, viewed from the side, rendered in a solid block of dark slate gray with a thin black outline. Instead of a brain, the head is filled with a complex system of interconnected, slowly rotating gears and abstract mechanical parts, all in varying shades of warm brown and gray. These gears turn with a deliberate, non-uniform motion, suggesting thought as a mechanical process. At the 4-second mark, the scene crossfades subtly. The gears inside the head dissolve and are replaced by a simple, stylized illustration of an ancient Greek automaton, like Talos, depicted in the same silhouette style. This figure is shown taking a rigid step. The background consists of layered geometric shapes—circles and rectangles in muted greens and browns—that create a sense of depth through a slight parallax effect as the camera pushes in. The entire visual has a subtle, paper-like grain texture. The scene begins to fade to black in the last half-second.",
				"text_overlay": "[IMPORTANT NOTE] Make sure this text is written in proper English and is spelled exactly as stated and spelled in the directions. No errors should be generated. The text overlay for this interval should be minimalistic to match the introductory and mysterious tone. At the 3-second mark, the words 'THE DREAM OF AI' appear on screen. The font should be a clean, sans-serif typeface in a warm brown color that complements the earthy palette. The text animates in with a soft, slow fade, letter by letter, taking about 2 seconds to become fully visible. It is positioned in the upper third of the 16:9 frame, ensuring it doesn't obstruct the primary visual of the head silhouette. The text remains on screen for approximately 4 seconds before beginning a slow fade-out in the final second of the interval, vanishing completely just as the scene transitions.",
				"camera": "The sequence begins with a static shot, then initiates a very slow push-in on the central silhouette of the human head. The movement is steady and cinematic, drawing the viewer's focus from the overall shape to the intricate mechanical workings within. The push-in lasts for the entire 8-second duration, creating a sense of delving deeper into a concept.",
				"animation_style_notes": "The animation is rendered in a flat 2D style at a smooth 24 fps. The color palette is composed of muted, earthy tones, specifically deep olive greens and slate grays, with a subtle grain texture over the entire frame to give it a hand-drawn feel. Characters and objects are depicted as simple, solid color block silhouettes with thin, dark outlines, avoiding any photo-realism. Backgrounds utilize layered geometric shapes that move with a slight parallax effect to create depth. Lighting is soft and directional, casting gentle shadows to add dimension. Transitions will primarily be crossfades and slow push-ins.",
				"audio_cue": "A low, mysterious synth pad hums throughout the interval. The sound of large, slow-turning mechanical gears grinding softly is layered on top. When the Greek automaton is shown, a single, faint metallic clank is heard, as if a metal foot has been set down. The overall mood is one of ancient mystery and nascent thought.",
				"narration": "Ever wonder where artificial intelligence came from? It wasn't a single 'eureka' moment. [1s pause] Instead, it was a slow burn of ideas, starting long before computers even existed, with ancient myths of artificial beings."

			"storyboard": {
				"visual": "[IMPORTANT NOTE] Follow the directions in this section exactly as stated when generating the video. Every interval should begin with a fading in animation and a fading out animation. The scene fades in to a silhouette of Alan Turing in a warm brown tone, standing on the left side of the frame. He is looking thoughtfully towards the right. Next to him, on the right, is a large, stylized, room-sized primitive computer from the 1950s, rendered in slate gray. A continuous stream of punch cards, depicted as simple rectangles with dot patterns, feeds into the machine from the far left, moving smoothly across the screen. As the cards move, abstract logic symbols—stylized representations of AND/OR gates and binary code (0s and 1s)—float gently upwards from them, glowing faintly in a lighter shade of brown. The background is a static composition of layered rectangles in deep olive green, creating a structured, academic environment. The hand-drawn texture is applied over all elements. The scene fades out in the final moments.",
				"text_overlay": "[IMPORTANT NOTE] Make sure this text is written in proper English and is spelled exactly as stated and spelled in the directions. No errors should be generated. At the 2-second mark, the name 'ALAN TURING' fades in next to his silhouette, using a serif font to evoke a historical feel. Simultaneously, the date '1950' appears in the bottom right corner in a smaller, sans-serif font. From seconds 3 to 6, the pivotal question 'Can machines think?' is animated on screen, appearing as if being typed out by an invisible typewriter, positioned prominently in the upper half of the frame. The font is a classic typewriter style, in an off-white color for high contrast against the muted background. This text overlay is crucial for highlighting the historical context and central theme of the interval.",
				"camera": "The camera performs a slow, deliberate pan from left to right across the 16:9 frame. It starts focused on the stack of punch cards and follows the path of a single card as it feeds into the primitive computer machine. This movement ensures the viewer sees Turing, the question, and the machine in a logical sequence, reinforcing the narrative flow.",
				"animation_style_notes": "Maintaining the 24 fps flat 2D animation style, this scene uses a palette of warm browns and slate grays. Alan Turing's figure is a distinct silhouette, allowing for focus on the conceptual elements. Logic symbols are simple, geometric shapes that float with gentle, independent physics. The background remains layered and geometric, reinforcing the infographic aesthetic. The animation of the punch card moving is smooth and linear, guiding the viewer's eye across the frame. All elements adhere to the silhouette-forward, textured, non-photorealistic design language.",
				"audio_cue": "The mysterious hum from the first interval is replaced by the distinct, rhythmic clacking sound of a teletype machine. This sound is continuous but not overpowering. Underneath this, a simple, thoughtful piano melody begins to play, conveying a sense of intellectual curiosity and the dawn of a new era. The music is more optimistic and structured than the previous cue.",
				"narration": "The real journey began in the mid-20th century. Visionaries like Alan Turing asked: 'Can machines think?' This question sparked a revolution, laying the theoretical groundwork for everything that was to come. The stage was set."

			"storyboard": {
				"visual": "[IMPORTANT NOTE] Follow the directions in this section exactly as stated when generating the video. Every interval should begin with a fading in animation and a fading out animation. The scene fades in to show the silhouette of a university building, clearly labeled 'DARTMOUTH' with simple block letters. The camera pushes through the building's facade to reveal an interior scene. Inside, several generic scientist silhouettes in dark gray are gathered around a large, round table. They are depicted in various poses of discussion and thought. From the heads of these figures, animated thought bubbles emerge. These bubbles contain simple, stylized iconography representing their ideas: branching tree diagrams, snippets of pseudo-code like 'IF-THEN', and logical symbols. The background is a composition of overlapping geometric shapes in deep olive green and slate gray, creating a formal, academic setting. The entire scene maintains the subtle grain texture, ensuring stylistic consistency. The scene fades out to prepare for the next interval.",
				"text_overlay": "[IMPORTANT NOTE] Make sure this text is written in proper English and is spelled exactly as stated and spelled in the directions. No errors should begenerated. The overlay text is central to this interval's story. At the 1-second mark, 'Dartmouth Workshop' appears at the top of the frame in a bold, capitalized, sans-serif font. Directly below it, the year '1956' fades in. Then, at the 4-second mark, timed with the script, the words 'Artificial Intelligence' are animated in the center of the screen. This text is larger and perhaps in a slightly different, more elegant font to give it prominence. As it appears, a soft glow emanates from it briefly. Finally, 'Birth of a Field' types out underneath it, reinforcing the workshop's legacy. Each piece of text uses a warm brown or off-white color for readability.",
				"camera": "The camera starts with a wide shot showing the entire Dartmouth College building silhouette. It then begins a slow, smooth push-in that moves through the 'wall' of the building, focusing more tightly on the central table where the silhouette figures are gathered. This movement creates a sense of zooming in on a historically significant moment, from the location to the people involved.",
				"animation_style_notes": "This scene continues the flat 2D, silhouette-forward style at 24 fps. The color palette remains consistent with deep olive greens, slate grays, and warm browns. The thought bubbles are animated with simple line drawings inside (code, trees) to convey complex ideas without detailed rendering. The layering of background shapes provides parallax movement during the push-in, enhancing the cinematic feel. The focus is on clear, infographic-style communication within the established aesthetic.",
				"audio_cue": "The sound of quiet, indistinct academic murmuring and contemplation can be heard softly in the background. At the moment the text 'Artificial Intelligence' is coined on screen, a single, clear, resonant 'ding' sound effect plays, marking the significance of the event. A hopeful, simple string arrangement begins to play, adding a sense of importance and collaborative breakthrough to the scene.",

			"storyboard": {
				"visual": "[IMPORTANT NOTE] Follow the directions in this section exactly as stated when generating the video. Every interval should begin with a fading in animation and a fading out animation. The interval opens with a timeline graphic dominating the 16:9 frame. A horizontal axis representing 'Time' is at the bottom. An animated line graph draws itself from left to right. The line dips down into two distinct valleys and rises into two peaks. The valleys, colored in cool shades of slate gray, are visually represented as 'winters' with small, gently falling snowflake icons inside them. In these valleys, small silhouettes of researchers are shown with slumped shoulders. The peaks, colored in warm browns, are 'springs,' marked by a simple sun icon with radiating lines. Here, the researcher silhouettes are shown standing tall and looking up. The background is a simple, layered composition of geometric shapes in a neutral olive green, ensuring the timeline graph is the main focus. The signature grain texture is present throughout.",
				"text_overlay": "[IMPORTANT NOTE] Make sure this text is written in proper English and is spelled exactly as stated and spelled in the directions. No errors should be generated. Text overlays are critical for labeling the infographic. As the line dips, the text 'AI WINTER' appears within the valley in a cool gray, serif font. When the line begins to rise, the words 'COMPUTING POWER' and 'MACHINE LEARNING' appear as small labels with arrows pointing upwards at the rising line, acting as drivers of the growth. These labels are in a warm brown, sans-serif font. The text is timed to appear exactly as the line passes through the corresponding section of the timeline, making the visual information clear and directly linked to the narration. This ensures the viewer understands the cause and effect described in the script.",
				"camera": "The camera executes a steady, continuous pan from left to right, following the animated line of the timeline graphic as it draws itself across the screen. This movement mirrors the chronological progression of time, guiding the viewer's eye through the 'winters' and 'springs' in sequence. The framing remains fixed vertically, focused on the timeline itself.",
				"animation_style_notes": "The 24 fps, flat 2D animation style is used here to create a clear infographic. The timeline is the central visual element. The 'winter' sections are defined by cool slate grays and simple animated snowflake icons. The 'spring' sections use warm browns and a simple sun icon. The line graph itself is a thick, solid line that animates across the screen. The figures are simple silhouettes expressing emotion through posture alone, in line with the minimalist character design. The entire animation is clean, textured, and easy to read.",
				"audio_cue": "The audio dynamically follows the visual. As the timeline enters the 'AI Winter' valley, the hopeful string music becomes sparse, slower, and more melancholic, with a faint sound of wind. When the line rises into the 'AI Spring,' the music swells back with energy, introducing electronic arpeggios and a stronger, optimistic beat, signifying renewed progress and excitement.",
				"narration": "But progress wasn't linear. Decades of soaring optimism were followed by 'AI winters'—periods of lost funding and slow progress. [1s pause] Yet, with each 'spring,' breakthroughs in computing power brought AI roaring back."

				"visual": "[IMPORTANT NOTE] Follow the directions in this section exactly as stated when generating the video. Every interval should begin with a fading in animation and a fading out animation. The final interval fades in, returning to the head silhouette from the very first scene, centered in the frame. However, the internal mechanics have evolved. The primitive gears are gone, replaced by a complex, glowing web of interconnected nodes and lines, representing a modern neural network. These lines, in a warm brown, pulse with a soft, rhythmic light, flowing from one node to another. This animation suggests advanced, dynamic, and organic thought. The background layers of geometric shapes resolve into a simple, clean, solid deep olive green. As the camera pulls out, the complexity within the head becomes a single, iconic image. The scene is designed to be a powerful, concluding visual that encapsulates the entire journey from mechanical ideas to digital intelligence, ending on a clean, branded frame.",
				"text_overlay": "[IMPORTANT NOTE] Make sure this text is written in proper English and is spelled exactly as stated and spelled in the directions. No errors should be generated. For the outro, the text reinforces the video's theme. At the 2-second mark, the phrase 'From Myth to Machine' animates in the center of the screen with a soft fade. This text stays for about 3 seconds before fading out. It is then replaced at the 6-second mark by the final call to action. This could be the channel's logo, or the text 'Stay Curious' which appears with a gentle scaling effect, growing slightly larger over one second. The font for all text is the clean, sans-serif typeface used previously, in a high-contrast off-white or warm brown, ensuring it is the final focal point for the viewer.",
				"camera": "The camera begins with a tight shot on the intricate neural network pattern inside the head silhouette. It then executes a slow pull-out over the course of the 8 seconds. This movement gradually reveals the full head silhouette again, echoing the first shot of the video, and finally settles on a centered composition showing the final text overlay or logo, providing a sense of closure and a complete journey.",
				"animation_style_notes": "Concluding with the established 24 fps flat 2D style, this scene transitions from the gears of the first interval to a more complex, organic pattern of a neural network. This visual evolution is key. The glowing lines of the network are animated to pulse softly, suggesting live, active processing. The color palette remains earthy, but the glow effect introduces a new, more modern element. The final composition is clean and centered, suitable for an outro card, while adhering to the silhouette and texture rules.",
				"audio_cue": "The music swells to an inspiring and conclusive crescendo, hitting its peak as the neural network fully forms. It then holds for a moment before beginning a slow fade-out over the final 3 seconds. As the final text overlay appears, a soft, clean 'whoosh' sound effect is heard. The video ends on a single, sustained, soft synth note that fades into silence.",
				"narration": "From ancient myths to modern neural networks, the story of AI is one of human ingenuity. Today, it's transforming our world in ways its creators could only dream of. [2s pause] What will the next chapter hold?"
